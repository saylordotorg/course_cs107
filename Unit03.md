**Unit 3: Object-Oriented Programming** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn how to design a class, which is an
expanded concept of a data structure that can hold both data and
functions.  An object is an instantiation of a class, so a class would
be the type, and an object would be the variable.  Next, we will learn
how to handle private and protected members of a class, which is
important for sound class design.*  
  
 *Note that this unit covers a key feature of C++ classes: inheritance. 
Inheritance allows classes to inherit objects and functions from other
classes.  In this unit, we will learn how classes can inherit members
from more than one class.  We will end this unit with the study of
polymorphism or the ability to create a variable, a function, or an
object that has more than one form*.  *This brings object-oriented
methodologies to their full potential.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 26 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.1: 5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.2: 5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.3: 3.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.4: 12.5 hours\*  
  
 *\*This large advisory is due to the lengthy and involved assignment in
Subunit 3.4.  You may be able to complete this assignment in less time
than is allotted here.*

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Define and compare/contrast constructors and deconstructors.
-   Design pointers to the class and create overloading operators.
-   Define and use the keyword “this” and use the static members
    appropriately.
-   Design and appropriately use friend functions and classes.
-   Use the class inheritance to design better code.
-   Explain how polymorphism is achieved through C++ code.

**3.1 Class Design** <span id="3.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: www.cplusplus.com: Juan Soulie’s “Classes (I)” and
    “Classes (II)”**
    Link: www.cplusplus.com: Juan Soulie’s [“Classes
    (I)”](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes/) (HTML) and
    [“Classes
    (II)”](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes2/) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read these webpages to learn about class design. 
    Make sure you know what constructors and deconstructors are, how to
    overload the constructors, and how the pointers to classes work. 
    Work through the examples given to learn how to overload operators,
    how to use the keyword “this,” and when to declare static members.  
      
     Reading these webpages and taking notes should take approximately 5
    hours.

**3.2 Inheritance Between Classes** <span id="3.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: www.cplusplus.com: Juan Soulie’s “Friendship and
    Inheritance”**
    Link: www.cplusplus.com: Juan Soulie’s [“Friendship and
    Inheritance”](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/inheritance/) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this entry to learn when it is appropriate to
    use friend functions and classes.  This entry will also teach you
    what is inherited from a base class and how multiple inheritance
    works.  
      
     Reading this entry and taking notes should take approximately 5
    hours.

**3.3 Polymorphism** <span id="3.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: www.cplusplus.com: Juan Soulie’s “Polymorphism”**
    Link: www.cplusplus.com: Juan Soulie’s
    [“Polymorphism”](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/polymorphism/) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this webpage to learn how to create and use
    pointers, virtual members, and abstract base classes.  As you read,
    pay special attention to how to create pointers to base classes,
    what a virtual member of a class is, and what an abstract base class
    is.  
      
     Reading this webpage and taking notes should take approximately 3.5
    hours.

**3.4 Coding Drills** <span id="3.4"></span> 
-   **Assessment: Saint Vincent College: David Carlson and Isidore
    Minerd's “Linked Lists”**
    Link: Saint Vincent College: David Carlson and Isidore Minerd's
    [“Linked
    Lists”](http://cis.stvincent.edu/html/tutorials/swd/lists/lists.html) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: First, read the linked article above.  Then, write a
    code for alinked list.  A linked list is a sequence of items that
    can only be accessed in order.  Each data item is stored in a node
    that also contains a pointer to the next node.  One possible
    solution is provided via the link above.  Before you check the
    solution, try to solve the problem by yourself.  Once you have
    solved it, or after you have spent a substantial amount of time
    working on it, check your work against the solution.  
      
     Completing this assessment should take approximately 12.5 hours.

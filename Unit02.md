**Unit 2: Dealing with Data and Compound Types** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, we will begin to use variables and constants.  We will
practice with an array, which is a series of elements of the same type
placed in contiguous memory locations.  Next, we will learn how to use
sequences of characters, which can form strings.  We will also discuss
how the memory of a computer can be understood as a succession of memory
cells that can be accessed through the pointer in order to better
control program instructions.  This unit also covers data structures,
which are groups of data elements grouped together under one name.  At
the end of the unit, we will study the C++ string class, which is useful
when handling and manipulating strings of characters.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 14 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.1: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.2: 5.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.3: 6.5 hours\*  
  
 *\*This large advisory is due to the lengthy and involved assignment in
Subunit 2.3.  You may be able to complete this assignment in less time
than is allotted here.*

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   List the operators in the C++ language.
-   Define and use arrays, struct, unions, and enumerations.
-   Use pointers.
-   Use the functions of the string class.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this webpage to learn how to use mathematical
    operators in C++.  You should know arithmetic, relational, equality,
    logical, conditional, bitwise, and explicit type casting operators. 
    Compile the code in the examples given.  Please pay attention to the
    rules about the precedence of operators.

-   **Reading: www.cplusplus.com: Juan Soulie’s “Arrays” and “Character
    Sequences”**
    Link: www.cplusplus.com: Juan Soulie’s
    [“Arrays”](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/arrays/) (HTML)
    and [“Character
    Sequences”](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/ntcs/) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read the first webpage to learn about arrays and how
    they are used in C++.  Then read the second page to learn about
    characters and null-terminated character sequences.  Compile the
    code in the examples given.  As you read, pay special attention to
    the differences and similarities of array and character sequences.
    Afterwards, you should know how to use both array and character
    sequences to denote text strings.

     Instructions: Read this webpage about pointers.  You should know
    what reference and dereference operators are and how to use them. 
    You should also be able to declare variables of pointer types,
    explain how pointers work with arrays, and understand basic pointer
    arithmetic.  Compile the code in the examples given.

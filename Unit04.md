**Unit 4: Advanced Concepts** <span id="4"></span> 
*This unit begins with a review of function and class templates, which
make programs adaptable.  We will then learn how to manipulate files. 
C++ provides the classes that can perform output and input of characters
to/from files. *  
  
 *This unit will also cover namespaces, which group entities like
classes, objects, and functions under a name.  We will finish the unit
with exception handling and preprocessor directives.  Exceptions handle
exceptional circumstances in our programs by transferring control to
special functions called handlers.  At the end of the unit, we will
discuss the preprocessor directives, lines included in the code of a
program that are not program statements but directives for the
preprocessor.*

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Write class and function templates.
-   Code with a class that manipulates the files.
-   Use namespaces and exceptions in C++ code.
-   Write preprocessor instructions.

**4.1 Templates** <span id="4.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: www.cplusplus.com: Juan Soulie’s “Templates”**
    Link: www.cplusplus.com: Juan Soulie’s
    [“Templates”](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/templates/) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read the linked material to learn how to write
    function and class templates.  Make sure you understand how
    templates can have regular typed parameters.  Please also work
    carefully through the examples given.  This reading also covers the
    following topics: template specialization, non-type parameters for
    templates, and templates and multiple file projects.  
      
     Reading this material and taking notes should take approximately 4
    hours.

**4.2 Input/Output With Files** <span id="4.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: www.cplusplus.com: Juan Soulie’s “Input/Output with
    Files”**
    Link: www.cplusplus.com: Juan Soulie’s [“Input/Output with
    Files”](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read the linked material to learn how to open and
    close files with C++.  Work carefully through the examples given. 
    This material also covers text files and binary files.  After
    reading this material, you should be able to open/create files, read
    from the files, search text in the files, write information to the
    files, and close the files.  
      
     Reading this material and taking notes should take approximately 3
    hours.

**4.3 Namespaces** <span id="4.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: www.cplusplus.com: Juan Soulie’s “Namespaces”**
    Link: www.cplusplus.com: Juan Soulie’s
    [“Namespaces”](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/namespaces/) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this article on the keyword “using” and
    namespace alias.  Then work carefully through the examples given.
     Pay special attention to how to group classes, objects, and
    functions under a name and how to put your program in an organized
    format.  
      
     Reading this webpage and taking notes should take approximately 1

    [“Exceptions”](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/exceptions/) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this webpage, which explains how to throw
    exceptions with C++ to catch errors.  Work through the examples
    given.  While reading, focus on the concepts of try, catch, and
    throw blocks. After reading this material, you should know how to
    write a simple exception blocks to catch the errors in the
    program.

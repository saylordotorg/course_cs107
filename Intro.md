Course Syllabus for "CS107: C++ Programming"
---------------------------------------------

In the first unit, we will learn the mechanics of editing and compiling
a simple program written in C++.  We will begin with a discussion of the
essential elements of C++ programming: variables, loops, expressions,
functions, and string class.  Next, we will cover the basics of
object-oriented programming: classes, inheritance, templates,
exceptions, and file manipulation.  We will then review function and
class templates and the classes that perform output and input of
characters to/from files.  This course will also cover the topics of
namespaces, exception handling, and preprocessor directives.  In the
last part of the course, we will learn some slightly more sophisticated
programming techniques that deal with data structures such as linked
lists and binary trees. This course contains a number of sample programs
and review exercises.  Through these exercises, students should better
learn how to write functions, use the string class, and write elementary
data structures such as linked lists and binary trees.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:  

-   Compile and execute code written in C++ language.
-   Work with the elementary data types and conditional and iteration
    structures.
-   Define and use functions, pointers, arrays, struct, unions, and
    enumerations.
-   Write C++ using principles of object-oriented programming.
-   Write templates and manipulate the files.
-   Code and use namespaces, exceptions, and preprocessor instructions.
-   Write a code that represents linked lists and binary trees.
-   Translate simple word problems into C++ language.
-   Perform debugging and fixing of common C++ errors.
-   Manage memory appropriately, including proper
    allocation/deallocation procedures.

### Course Requirements

In order to take this course you must:  
  
 √    Have access to a computer. Have continuous broadband Internet
access.  
  
 √    Have the ability/permission to install plug-ins or software (e.g.,
Adobe Reader, Flash, compilers).  
  
 √    Have the ability to download and save files and documents to a
computer.  
  
 √    Have the ability to open Microsoft files and documents (.doc,
.ppt, .xls, etc.).  
  
 √    Be competent in the English language.  
  
 √    Have read the [Saylor Student
Handbook](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Saylor-StudentHandbook.pdf).  
  
 √    Have completed [CS101: Introduction to Computer Science
I](http://www.saylor.org/courses/cs101/) and [CS102: Introduction to
Computer Science II](http://www.saylor.org/courses/cs102/).

### Course Information

Welcome to CS107.  General information on the course and its
requirements can be found below.  
  
 **Course Designer:** Dr. Yongge Wang  
  
 **Primary Resources:** This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following resources:  

-   cplusplus.com's [“C++ Language
    Tutorial”](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)
-   NetBeans' [“NetBeans IDE Download”](http://netbeans.org/downloads/)
-   KeithSchwarz.com's CS106 [“Problem
    Set”](http://www.keithschwarz.com/cs106l/spring2009/)
-   cppreference.com's [“C++ Reference”](http://en.cppreference.com/w/)
-   Tulane University: Marko Puljic's [“List of Binary
    Trees”](http://www.tulane.edu/~mpuljic/cpp/secondAss.shtml)
-   Saint Vincent College: David Carlson and Isidore Minerd's [“Linked
    Lists”](http://cis.stvincent.edu/html/tutorials/swd/lists/lists.html)
-   MIT: John Marrero's [“Flow of
    Control”](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-096-introduction-to-c-january-iap-2011/lecture-notes/)
-   Bruce Eckel's [“Thinking in C++: Volume 1, Chapter 3: 'Debugging
    Hints”](http://www.mindviewinc.com/Books/downloads.html)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials,
including the quizzes and the final exam.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam. 
In order to "pass" this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment: **This course should take you a total of 114.5 hours
to complete.  Each unit includes a "time advisory" that lists the amount
of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These should help
you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and determine how much time you have over the next
few weeks to complete each unit and then set goals for yourself.  For
example, Unit 1 should take you 15.5 hours.  Perhaps you can sit down
with your calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1 and 1.2 (a total
of 3 hours) on Monday night, subunit 1.3 (a total of 6.5 hours) on
Tuesday and Wednesday nights, and so forth.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions:** As noted in the "Course Requirements," CS101 and
CS102 are prerequisites for this course.  If you are struggling with
object-oriented programing concepts as you progress through this course,
consider taking a break to revisit CS101 and CS102, focusing especially
on Units 2, 3, and 4 of CS102.

**Unit 5: Memory Management and Testing** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, we will work on memory management and debugging methods.
 The unit begins with an introduction on general techniques in C++
program memory management.  We will then learn how to design testing
cases to cover the program under testing and learn commonly used
techniques for debugging C++ programs.*

     Instructions: Please read this webpage, which explains how to use
    the debug tool to debug your C and C++ programs, and (optionally)
    explore the related links within the page.  Since you do not have
    access to the debugging tool mentioned on the webpage, you do not
    need to practice using the tools.  You should take away some
    high-level ideas on how a debugging tool would help you to debug
    your program.

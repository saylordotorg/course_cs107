**Unit 1: Introduction and Setup** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit presents a brief history of C++ before addressing the
mechanics of editing and compiling a simple program written in C++ using
a Linux-flavored operating system and a NetBeans IDE (integrated
development environment).  We will focus on learning how to write a
general format for a C++ program, the meaning of main() function, how to
use the cout and cin objects, how to declare and use variables, and how
to define simple functions.*

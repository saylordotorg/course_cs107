**Unit 6: Useful Examples and C++ Glossary** <span id="6"></span> 
*In this unit, we will work on coding skills using two useful data
structures: linked list and binary tree.  The first assessment you will
encounter below will teach you to program the binary tree.  The second
assessment will ask you to be creative with coding linked lists and
binary trees.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 25 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.1: 12 hours\*  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.2: 12 hours\*  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.3: 1 hour  
  
 *\*This large advisory is due to the lengthy and involved assignments
in subunits 6.1 and 6.2. You may be able to complete these assignments
in less time than is allotted here.*

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Describe and code the binary tree structure.
-   Code special data structures by combining linked lists and binary
    trees.

     Instructions: First, read the article linked above.  Then, write a
    code for abinary tree.  Note that each node can have zero, one, or
    two children.  In addition, each child node is clearly identified as
    either the left child or the right child.  One possible solution is
    provided via the link above.  Before you check the solution, try to
    solve the problem by yourself.  Once you have solved it, or after
    you have spent a substantial amount of time working on it, check
    your work against the solution.  
      
     Completing this assessment may take up to 12 hours.

    Link: Wikispaces: *CSE222* [“Binary Tree
    Exercise”](http://resources.saylor.org.s3.amazonaws.com/CS/CS107/CS107-6.2-BinaryTreeExcercise-CC-BYSA_files/CS107-6.2-BinaryTreeExcercise-CC-BYSA.htm) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: This exercise uses both binary trees and linked
    lists. It first builds a binary tree to represent text. The nodes of
    the tree represent the words of the text. In this representation,
    the alphabetical order of the words is used to determine whether a
    word is placed using the right branch or the left branch of a node.
    For example, if the first word begins with an *f* and the second
    word begins with an *s*, then the second word would be stored as the
    right descendant of the node for the first word.  
      
     Once the structure of the binary tree is defined, functions can be
    created that operate on the binary tree structure. To test your
    code, this example uses Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Two links in
    left hand column (“Gettysburg Address” and “Gettysburg, just the
    words”) help you visualize the input data and the resulting binary
    tree. Note that binary trees are useful for storing data in a manner
    that facilitates searching that data. For this reason, data is put
    into the binary tree in a specific order. Note also, that some of
    the illustrations on this page may use C instead of C++. However,
    this link is intended to help you come up with a plan for solving
    the problem; use your knowledge of C++ learned in this course to
    code the problem.  
        
     In summary, to solve the problem:

    -   1) understand the requirements of the problem (i.e. what you
        have to do);
    -   2) design a solution to solve the problem, including a data
        structure and procedures or functions that operate on the data
        structure;
    -   3) code your design in C++; and
    -   4) test your code using the “Gettysburg Address” found on the
        linked page above.

       
     Once the binary tree representation of the text is built, the next
    part of the assessment is to create a linked list that will visit
    the nodes of the binary tree, i.e. walk the tree in such a way that
    you visit the nodes in the order in which the test is read, e.g.
    “Four score and seven years ago, our forefathers…” The binary tree
    representation stores the words of the text using an alphabetical
    order. The link list represents the reading order of the words as
    they appear in the text.  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 12 hours.
